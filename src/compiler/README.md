# 6.1100 Decaf Compiler Typescript Skeleton

In this repo you will find a skeleton for the Decaf compiler project. You may organize this project in any way you see fit as long as the ``build.sh`` and `run.sh` files build and run your compiler respectively.

This skeleton uses Node for builds and Mocha for unit tests. For an instruction on how to install Typescript, please follow [the instructions from 6.102](https://web.mit.edu/6.102/www/sp24/tools/getting-started/).
